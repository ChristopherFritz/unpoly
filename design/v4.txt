- Remove up.form.config.watchInputEvents
- Remove up.form.config.watchChangeEvents
- Remove doc section "Normalizing non-standard events"
- Use Array#toReversed() in up.LayerStack
- Async compiler functions (see separate doc)
- Check browser support for Element#focus({ focusVisible }) option
- Consider requiring elements for functions that work with elements, not selectors or jQuery collections
- [up-instant] and [up-preload] should listen on pointerdown instead of mousedown
- [v4] Document throws
  - But consider waiting until async compilers, as we're changing some method signatures
  - How do we document async rejections?
    - up.link.preload documents in @return
- [v4] Consider removing X-Up-Title, [up-title] and { title } since we now auto-update head elements
- [v4] Consider moving history-related methods from up.Layer.Base to up.history
  - All other packages work by taking a { layer } option, why not history-related?
